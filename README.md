# AUTOMATIC-CITRUS-FRUIT-DISEASE-DETECTION
MACHINE LEARNING MINI PROJECT

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect diseases in citrus fruits using image phenotyping techniques. 
The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for efficient and accurate classification of citrus fruit diseases.

Features

Image Preprocessing: Automated preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and resizing images.
Disease Classification: Identifies specific diseases affecting citrus fruits.
User-Friendly: Designed to be deployed in agricultural sectors for real-time disease detection.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CNN model.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing results.
Flask/Django: For deploying the model.
